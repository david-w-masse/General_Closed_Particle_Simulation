Segments must be an ordered list of 2 dimensional points proceeding counterclockwise around the boundary.

It is assumed that the last point connects to the first.

No error checking is done on the geometry.

Ensure particle interaction range does not extend further than one neighbor in the cell array.

Geometry Must be inside simulation region.
